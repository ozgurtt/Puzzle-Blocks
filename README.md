Puzzle-Blocks
=============

A small gameplay demo that I made in Unity us C# to play with the new 2D features. It is a fusion of puzzle platforming and placing tetris blocks.

Use the arrow keys to move your character and space to jump
Press X to place a block, now the arrow keys will move the blocks and r will rotate the block
You can press Z to undo your most recent block placement

The goal is to place the blocks so that you can escape the level.

A web build can be player here: http://pthurston.github.io/PuzzleBlocks-v0.1/WebPlayer.html
